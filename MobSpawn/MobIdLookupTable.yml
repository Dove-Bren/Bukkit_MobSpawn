#this is what it's GOING to look like, but this file will not be included in final .jar
#nor is it referenced in current builds. This is just for us to be able to use it quickly

#Any changes to this must be implemented in the makeMobIdLookupTable method in MobSpawn.java!!!!!!
#!!!Yaml setup has been changed!!!#

#Types now define if the mob type is simple, double, or complex.
#If it's simple, nothing need follow; string SHOULD BE converted to all caps and used to lookup value in EntityType

#Double classes need two strings to follow the declaration as double; the entity on bottom and the entity on top.
#in addition (since mobs on other mobs tend to be invisible) anything after second entity type signals invis top 
#mob

#Complex classes need nothing to follow, as they are defined more abstractly below

#Entity names following doubles MUST BE VALID IN org.bukkit.entity.EntityType

Types:
  zombie: simple
  zombie_on_zombie: double ZOMBIE ZOMBIE
  skeleton: simple
  skeleton_on_skeleton: double SKELETON SKELETON
  totem_pole: complex
  ghast_on_creeper: double CREEPER GHAST true
  pig_mutated: complex

#The following rates section describes how often a mob is made. This literally is the chance that, even if the mob is randomly selected, it will actually be created.
#The number should be 1 through 100 describing the percent-chance of being instantiated. If the mob isn't instantiated, a new random mob type is picked and it starts over again
Rates:
  zombie: 80
  zombie_on_zombie: 50
  skeleton: 70
  skeleton_on_skeleton: 40
  totem_pole: 8
  ghast_on_creeper: 15
  pig_mutated: 30
