    This is meant to be a plugin for our locally operated and maintained Minecraft Bukkit server. 
    Plugin is designed to either take in a config file with what mobs can be spawned, the rate at which they should be spawned, and whether or not they should be spawned in groups or uniformly (as was decided en meetin').
    Fear the awesome power that is Bukkit, and the combined efforts of master programming haxers. Fear noob.
